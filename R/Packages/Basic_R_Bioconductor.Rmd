# Bioconductor

> Bioconductor is a free, open source and open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data generated by wet lab experiments in molecular biology.

[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) is a specialist repository of packages dedicated to genomic data analysis. It is maintained independently of CRAN and has additional checks in place for packages to be included.

The BiocManager package is available in CRAN and enables you to get started quickly with Bioconductor packages.

```{r bioc1, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install()
```

To get comfortable with Bioconductor, I recommend [The Bioconductor 2018 Workshop Compilation](https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops/index.html)
