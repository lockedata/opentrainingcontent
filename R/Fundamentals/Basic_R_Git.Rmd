## Source control concepts

Source control is a system for tracking changes to files over time.

What's the point?

- No version hell
- Why did I do that?
- Satisfy auditors
- UNDO, UNDO, UNDO!!

What techs are there?

- Central systems like SVN
- Distributed systems like Git
- Hybrid systems like TFS

Why GitHub?

- Git is awesome
- Public / private models
- Great UX
- Great integrations

## Git glossary

 - Repository: Your project and it's history
 - Remote: The (TFS/GitHub/VSO etc) server
 - Clone:Take a linked copy of a repository
 - Fork: Take an unlinked copy of a repository
 - Pull: Update your copy of a repository
 - Add: Include a file in a change
 - Commit: Make the latest state of all the added files the new default state
 - Push: Update the central copy of the repository with your commits

## Getting started

### Gists
- README
- Revisions

### Creating a gist in R

First we need to get ready 
```{r Basic_R_Git-2, eval=do_eval}
library(gistr)
gistr::gist_auth()
```

Then we can use `gist_create()` to send a file to gist.github.com

```{r Basic_R_Git-3, eval=do_eval}
res1<-
  gistr::gist_create(files = "../samples/README.Rmd",
                     description = "Example code",
                     browse = FALSE,
                     public = FALSE
  )
```

```{r Basic_R_Git-4, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=do_eval}
gistr::delete(res1)
```

The `files` argument will take a vector so you can upload mutliple files at once.

```{r Basic_R_Git-5, eval=do_eval}
res2<-
  gistr::gist_create(files = c("../samples/README.Rmd", "../samples/README1.Rmd"),
                     description = "Example code",
                     browse = FALSE,
                     public = FALSE
  )
```

```{r Basic_R_Git-6, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=do_eval}
gistr::delete(res2)
```

Alternatively, we can include a destination filename for some code that we'd like to add to a gist.

```{r Basic_R_Git-7, eval=do_eval}
res3<-
  gistr::gist_create(description = "Example code",
                   filename = "gistrExample.R",
                   browse = FALSE,
                   public = FALSE,
code={'
  gistr::gist_create(description = "Example code",
                   filename = "gistrExample.R",
                   code={"library(gistr)"}
'})
```

Once you have a gist object in R, you can then do things like update the files and then send that update to the online gist.

```{r Basic_R_Git-8, eval=do_eval}
update(update_files(res3,"../samples/README.Rmd"))
```


```{r Basic_R_Git-9, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=do_eval}
gistr::delete(res3)
```

### Exercise
1. Add one of your files to a gist

## Your local workflow

```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

- [SSH key set up](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

### Add git to existing projects
- Tools > Version Control > Project Setup

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYkaGwoO1q4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>



### Committing your code - in a GUI
- Select changed / new / deleted files to commit
- Hit "Commit"
- Add Short tile for change
- Hit Enter, and add details
- Hit commit

```bash
git init
git add somefile.R
git commit -m "Some message"
```

### Exercise
1. Add git to a directory
2. Commit some code

## Your distributed workflow
### Using existing repos
- Get a URL
- File > New Project > Version Control > Git 
- C&P URL

#### Exercises
1. Go to GitHub and "Fork" [lockedata/sampleProject](https://github.com/lockedata/sampleProject)
2. Go to your copy and copy the "Clone with SSH" URL
2. Clone the repo using the cmd line

### Adding an external source
- Create new repository in GitHub
- Get code for "existing repository"
- Open shell
- Copy & paste

### Upload your code
- Use the GUI to commit code
- Hit Push!

### Exercise
1. Create repo online for one of your projects
1. With your code all committed, add the online repo
1. Upload your code

### Checking for changes
Use the "pull" to get the latest copy of code online.

### Exercises
1. Pull the latest copy of your code

## Good practices

### Commit often
Keep changes as small as possible to avoid loss and more pain later.

### Pull then Push
Before you push your changes always hit pull first!

### Merge conflicts
Merge conflicts happen when multiple people have done something to the same lines at the same time and git doesn't know which one to pick. 

Resolve by picking which bits you want. Commit and push!

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
I tried changing to this line
=======
And I tried changing to this line
>>>>>>> COMMITONREMOTE
```

to

```
And I tried changing to this line
```

### Exercises
- Alter a line on your README and commit it locally
- Alter the same line differently online and commit it
- Pull the changes
- Fix the merge conflict in your text editor / R
- Commit and push the fix
