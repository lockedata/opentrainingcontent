# Analysing big data with Microsoft ML Server
# 2. Overview of the Microsft ML Server and getting started

## Decision trees
Purpose: predict a discrete outcome


```{r Basic_MLServer_R_getting_started-1, echo=FALSE}
a1 <- 'a'
```

## Function 
Therer are number of decision tree R packages, here I use FFTrees for the superior visualisations.

```{r Basic_MLServer_R_getting_started-2}
a <- c(1,2,3)
```


## Exercises
1. Build a decision tree for predicting the `y` column in the `bank` dataset
2. What are the most important factors in this tree?
