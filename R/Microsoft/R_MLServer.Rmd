## Key things to think about
- How much data do you really need to analyse in one go?
- What data sources do you need to connect to?
- What sort of locations will you be publishing your models?

## Packages
Many of these packages are available to you through CRAN.

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|checkpoint	|Install packages from snapshots on the checkpoint server for reproducibility (maintained by Microsoft)|
|curl	| A modern and flexible web client for R
|deployrRserve	| DeployR fork of the popular R package, Rserve for use with Microsoft R Server Linux & Windows Only (maintained by Microsoft)|
|doParallel	|Provides a parallel backend for the %dopar% function using the parallel package (maintained by Microsoft)|

|translations	| While this is a not a standard package, it is part of the standard R build and contains a compilations of the localized versions of R's messages. |

As well as these I recommend [`dplyrXdf`](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/dplyrXdf) for workinng with dplyr.

## Chunks
`RevoScaleR` package stores the dataset on disk (hard drive) and loads it only a **chunk** at a time (where each chunk is a certain number of rows) for processing (reading or writing). Once a chunk is processed, it then moves to the next chunk of the data. By default, the **chunk size** is set to 500K rows, but we can change it to a lower number when dealing with *wider* datasets (hundreds or thousands of columns), and a larger number when dealing with *longer* data sets (only a handful of columns).

So data in `RevoScaleR` is *external* (because it's stored on disk) and *distributed* (because we process it chunk-wise).

# Typical workflows

## Local with R
1. Collect data with RODBC or something
2. Clean up data
3. Build model
4. Make model useful later
   + Save model object to disk
   + Make into an API

## Local with Microsoft R Client
1. Collect data with RODBC or something
2. Turn into an xdf
2. Clean up data with `dplyrXdf`
3. Build model using an rx* function
4. Make model useful later
   + Save model object to disk using `rxSerializeModel`
   + Make into an API using `mrsdeploy`

## Semi-local
1. Connect to data using RevoScaleR
2. Clean up data with `rx*` functions
3. Build model using an `rx*` function
4. Make model useful later
   + Save model object to disk using `rxSerializeModel`
   + Make into an API using `mrsdeploy`

## Remote
1. Write code
1. Run locally on a sample
2. Send code to remote server with `mrsdeploy`

# Using Microsoft Client
## RStudio
1. Make the Client your default R exe by going to Tools > Global Options > R version
2. Restart RStudio

## Libraries
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-1}
library(DBI)
library(odbc)
library(tidyverse)

if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
if(!require(dplyrXdf)) devtools::install_github("RevolutionAnalytics/dplyrXdf")
library(dplyrXdf)
```

# Workflow
## Turn some data into an xdf
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-2}
if(!require(ggplot2movies)) install.packages("ggplot2movies")
library(ggplot2movies)

imdb_movies <- rxDataStep(movies, "movies.xdf", overwrite=TRUE)
```

You can get an overview of the table with `rxGetInfo()` as opposed to the usual `str()` and `summary()`.

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-3}
rxGetInfo(imdb_movies, verbose = 1)
```


### Exercise
1. Install `nycflights13` if it isn't already installed
2. Make an xdf for `nycflights13::flights`

## Use dplyrXdf
You can then point at an xdf and use the sorts of dplyr querying we're used to. 

When we assign into an object, this is also an xdf. This means to view the results you have to use something that accesses the "data.frame bit" of the object. 


```{r Basic_R_MLServer-4}
imdb_movies %>% 
  filter(length < 60*5 ) %>% 
  group_by(Action) %>% 
  summarise(mean(rating)) ->
  action_or_not

head(action_or_not)
```

### Exercises
1. Produce some summaries to help us understand the data
2. Read the docs for a data dictionary

## dplyrXdf limitations
The supported tidyverse verbs currently supported are:
- `filter` and `select` to choose rows and columns
- `mutate` and `transmute` to do data transformation
- `group_by` to define groups
- `summarise` to carry out computations on (un)grouped data
- `arrange` to sort by variables
- `rename` to rename columns
- `distinct` to drop duplicates
- `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join` and `full_join`
- `anti_join` and `semi_join`
- `union` and `union_all`

This means if you want to use another verb that is not supported, you need to convert to a data.frame / data_frame first.

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-5}
imdb_movies %>% 
  filter(length < 60*5 ) %>% 
  group_by(Action, Romance) %>% 
  summarise(avg=mean(rating)) %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  spread(Romance,avg)
```

## Using RevoScaleR for transformation
Instead of using dplyrXdf, which is not currently on CRAN, you could use RevoScaleR functions:
- `rxDataStep`
    + Drop columns
    + Filter rows
    + Apply transformations
    + Drop missings
    + Slice data
- `rxFactors` for recoding factors

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-6}
imdb_movies %>% 
  rxDataStep(outFile="../samples/movies_filtered.xdf",
         rowSelection=(length < 60*5),
         transforms=list(Action=factor(Action))  , overwrite=TRUE
            ) %>% 
  head()
  
```

## Building plots
Unfortunately xdf's are not compatible with ggplot2  -- you would need to convert to a data.frame first. Alternatively there are some plot functions available to us in RevoScaleR.

Plots in RevoScaleR are:

- `rxHistogram` for box charts
- `rxLinePlot` for line charts

These plots take:

- `formula`
- `data`
- lots and lots of other arguments that can do
    + formatting
    + variable transformation
    + filtering records

The formula should be like `y ~ x` and in a histogram the `y` isn't required. Additionally, you can add fields to the facetting by putting a `| field + field`. Facet variables must be factors for the rx functions, you can use `F()` inside the formula to convert columns.


```{r Basic_R_MLServer-7}
imdb_movies %>% 
  filter(length < 60*5 ) %>% 
  RevoScaleR::rxHistogram(~rating | F(Action) + F(Romance), data=.)
    ```

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-8}
imdb_movies %>% 
  filter(length < 60*5 ) %>%
  mutate(rnd_rating=factor(floor(rating)),
         Action=factor(Action))%>% 
  group_by(Action, rnd_rating) %>% 
    summarise(budget=mean(budget))  %>% 
  RevoScaleR::rxLinePlot(budget~rnd_rating | Action, data=.)
```

### Exercises
1. Produce a chart that shows the distribution of flights by month for each year

## Sampling data
We shouldn't work on all of our data for building models. We need to take a dataset for training and a dataset for testing our model.

Note that you can't perform sampling with replacement particularly easily using the XDFs -- as a consequence bootstrapping or oversampling are difficult things to do.

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-9}
imdb_movies %>% 
  sample_frac(0.7) ->
  movies_training

imdb_movies %>% 
  anti_join(movies_training) ->
  movies_testing
```

A faster but less readable method is using `rxSplit()` -- this will create a list object with two elements.

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-10}
create_partition <- function(xdf,
    partition_size = 0.7) {
    splitDS <- rxSplit(
    inData = xdf,
    transforms = list(traintest = factor(ifelse(
    rbinom(.rxNumRows,
    size = 1, prob = splitperc),
    "train",
    "test"
    ))),
    transformObjects = list(splitperc = partition_size),
    outFileSuffixes = c("train", "test"),
    splitByFactor = "traintest",
    overwrite = TRUE
    )
    
    return(splitDS)
    
}
                             
movies_splits <- create_partition(imdb_movies)
names(movies_splits) <- c("train", "test")
```

### Exercise
Produce an 80:20 sample set from your movies xdf

## Evaluating features

### Correlation
Check for highly correlated numeric variables using the function `rxCor()`

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-11}
rxCor(~votes + length + budget , data = movies_training)
```

This can be used to make decisions about removing variables.

The `findCorrelation()` function from the caret package will identify variables you can remove. If it returns `integer(0)` no variables are recommended for removal.

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-12}
library(caret)
movies_training %>% 
  rxCor(~votes + length + budget , data = .) %>% 
  caret::findCorrelation()
```



### caret
`caret` is great but doesn't work on XDFs -- you will need to do a conversion to data.frame first. It is however much nicer for feature engineering and doing data preparation.

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-13}
movies_training %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  caret::nearZeroVar()
```

### Exercises
Add some features to the data and remove ones that will not help us

## Build models 

- RevoScaleR functions do not support `y ~ .` notation for formulae.
- Use `F()` to make variables into factors, inside the model
- Documentation is pretty good at [Models in RevoScaleR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning-server/r/how-to-revoscaler-models)

### Predicting continuous variables

#### Linear regression
To build a linear model use `rxLinMod` instead of `lm`.

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-14}
movies_training %>% 
  rxLinMod(rating~ year +  length + F(Comedy) + F(Action) + F(Romance) + F(Short) + F(Documentary) + F(Animation) + F(Drama), 
           data=.
           )
```

#### Decision Tree
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-15}
movies_training %>% 
  rxDTree(rating~ year + budget + length + Comedy + Action + Romance + Short + Documentary + Animation + Drama, 
           data=.
           ) -> 
  movies_rdtree

movies_rdtree
```

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-16}
library(RevoTreeView)
movies_rdtree %>% 
  rxAddInheritance() %>% 
  plot()
```

#### Exercise
Construct a model to predict the arr_delay for flights.

### Classification
#### Logistic regression
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-17}
movies_training %>% 
  rxLogit(Comedy~ rating +year + budget + length + F(Action) + F(Romance) + F(Short) + F(Documentary) + F(Animation) + F(Drama), 
           data=.
           ) ->
  movies_logit

movies_logit
```

#### Decision Tree
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-18}
movies_training %>% 
  rxDTree(Comedy~ rating +year + budget + length +  Action + Romance + Short + Documentary + Animation + Drama, 
           data=. , method = "class"
           ) ->
  movies_dtree

movies_dtree
```

##### Pruning the tree
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-19}
movies_dtree %>% 
  rxAddInheritance() %>% 
  plotcp()
```

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-20}
movies_rdtree %>% 
  rxDTreeBestCp() ->
  best_cp

movies_dtree %>% 
 prune(cp=best_cp) ->
  movies_dtree
```

##### Visualising the tree
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-21, eval=FALSE}
movies_dtree %>% 
  createTreeView() %>% 
  plot()
```

#### Boosted decision trees
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-22}
movies_training %>% 
  rxBTrees(Comedy~ rating +year + budget + length +  Action + Romance + Short + Documentary + Animation + Drama, 
           data=.
           )
```



```{r Basic_R_MLServer-23, eval=FALSE}
library(RevoTreeView)
movies_training %>% 
  rxDTree(Comedy~ rating +year + budget + length ,
           data=., class
           ) -> 
  movies_dtree

movies_dtree %>% 
  rxAddInheritance() %>% 
  plot()
```

### Clustering
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-24}
movies_training %>% 
  rxKmeans(~ rating +year  + length + Comedy+ Action + Romance + Short + Documentary + Animation + Drama,
           data=.,numClusters = 10)
```

#### Exercises
Produce your own cluster model -- what seem to be the key clustering criteria?

## Evaluation


### Predict on new data
Once you've made predictions you can use R packages to do evaluations.

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-25}
movies_testing %>% 
  rxPredict(movies_rdtree, .) %>% 
  summary()
```

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-26}
movies_testing %>% 
  rxPredict(movies_rdtree, .) ->
  movies_testing

plot(movies_testing$rating, movies_testing$rating_Pred)
```

### ROC curves
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-27}
movies_testing %>% 
  rxPredict(movies_dtree, data=., 
            predVarNames="Comedy_Pred",
             type="vector") %>% 
  rxRocCurve(actualVarName="Comedy", predVarNames = "Comedy_Pred", data=.)

```

```{r Basic_R_MLServer-28}
movies_testing %>% 
  rxLorenz("Comedy_Pred","Comedy", data=.) %>% 
  plot()
```

### Variable importance
```{r Basic_R_MLServer-29}
movies_dtree %>% 
  rxVarImpPlot()
```

### Exercises
Predict the clusters for your test movies
